"""
(Python >3.3)

This is an example of how we can embed a Python REPL into an asyncio
application. In this example, we have one coroutine that runs in the
background, prints some output and alters a global state. The REPL, which runs
inside another coroutine can access and change this global state, interacting
with the running asyncio application.
The ``patch_stdout`` option makes sure that when another coroutine is writing
to stdout, it won't break the input line, but instead writes nicely above the
prompt.
