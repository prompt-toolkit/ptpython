CHANGELOG
=========

3.0.23: 2023-02-22
------------------

Fixes:
- Don't print exception messages twice for unhandled exceptions.
- Added cursor shape support.

Breaking changes:
- Drop Python 3.6 support.


3.0.22: 2022-12-06
------------------

New features:
- Improve rendering performance when there are many completions.


3.0.21: 2022-11-25
------------------

New features:
- Make ptipython respect more config changes.
  (See: https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/ptpython/pull/110 )
- Improved performance of `DictionaryCompleter` for slow mappings.

Fixes:
- Call `super()` in `PythonInputFilter`. This will prevent potentially breakage
  with an upcoming prompt_toolkit change.
  (See: https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/pull/1690 )
- Improved type annotations.
- Added `py.typed` to the `package_data`.


3.0.20: 2021-09-14
------------------

New features:
- For `DictionaryCompleter`: show parentheses after methods.

Fixes:
- Don't crash when trying to complete broken mappings in `DictionaryCompleter`.
- Don't crash when an older version of `black` is installed that is not
  compatible.


3.0.19: 2021-07-08
------------------

Fixes:
- Fix handling of `SystemExit` (fixes "ValueError: I/O operation on closed
  file").
- Allow usage of `await` in assignment expressions or for-loops.


3.0.18: 2021-06-26
------------------

Fixes:
- Made "black" an optional dependency.


3.0.17: 2021-03-22
------------------

Fixes:
- Fix leaking file descriptors due to not closing the asyncio event loop after
  reading input in a thread.
- Fix race condition during retrieval of signatures.


3.0.16: 2021-02-11
------------------

(Commit 7f619e was missing in previous release.)

Fixes:
- Several fixes to the completion code:
  * Give dictionary completions priority over path completions.
  * Always call non-fuzzy completer after fuzzy completer to prevent that some
    completions were missed out if the fuzzy completer doesn't find them.


3.0.15: 2021-02-11
------------------

New features:
- When pressing control-w, only delete characters until a punctuation.

Fixes:
- Fix `AttributeError` during retrieval of signatures with type annotations.


3.0.14: 2021-02-10
------------------

New features:
- Display of signature and completion drop down together.
- If `DictionaryCompleter` is enabled, also retrieve signatures when Jedi
  fails, using the same logic.
- List function parameters first and private attributes at the end in the
  completion menu.
- Cleanup of the completion code.

Fixes:
- Handle exceptions raised when `repr()` is called.
- Fix leakage of `exc_info` from eval to exec call.
- Fix handling of `KeyboardInterrupt` in REPL during evaluation of `__repr__`.
- Fix style for signature toolbar.
- Hide signature when sidebar is visible.


3.0.13: 2021-01-26
------------------

New features:
- Added 'print all' option to pager.
- Improve handling of indented code:
  * Allow multiline input to be indented as a whole (we will unindent before
    executing).
  * Correctly visualize tabs (instead of ^I, which happens when pasted in
    bracketed paste).

Fixes:
- Fix line ending bug in pager.


3.0.12: 2021-01-24
------------------

New features:
- Expose a `get_ptpython` function in the global namespace, to get programmatic
  access to the REPL.
- Expose `embed()` at the top level of the package. Make it possible to do
  `from ptpython import embed`.

Fixes:
- Properly handle exceptions when trying to access `__pt_repr__`.
- Properly handle `SystemExit`.


3.0.11: 2021-01-20
------------------

New features:
- Add support for top-level await.
- Refactoring of event loop usage:

  * The ptpython input UI will now run in a separate thread. This makes it
    possible to properly embed ptpython in an asyncio application, without
    having to deal with nested event loops (which asyncio does not support).

  * The "eval" part doesn't anymore take place within a ptpython coroutine, so
    it can spawn its own loop if needed. This also fixes `asyncio.run()` usage
    in the REPL, which was broken before.

- Added syntax highlighting and autocompletion for !-style system commands.

Fixes:
- Remove unexpected additional line after output.
- Fix system prompt. Accept !-style inputs again.
- Don't execute PYTHONSTARTUP when -i flag was given.

  collections.abc). Note that dictionary completion is still turned off by
  default.

-----------------

New features:
- Optional output formatting using Black.
- Optional pager for displaying outputs that don't fit on the screen.
- Added --light-bg and --dark-bg flags to automatically optimize the brightness
  of the colors according to the terminal background.
- Add `PTPYTHON_CONFIG_HOME` for explicitly setting the config directory.
- Show completion suffixes (like '(' for functions).

Fixes:
- Fix dictionary completion on Pandas objects.
- Stop using deprecated Jedi functions.


3.0.7: 2020-09-25
-----------------

New features:
- Option to show/hide private attributes during a completion
- Added `insert_blank_line_after_input` option similar to
  `insert_blank_line_after_output`.

Fixes:
- Fixed some formatting issues of `__pt_repr__`.
- Abbreviate completion meta information for dictionary completer if needed.


3.0.6: 2020-09-23
-----------------

New features:
- (Experimental) support for `__pt_repr__` methods. If objects implement this
  method, this will be used to print the result in the REPL instead of the
  normal `__repr__`.
- Added py.typed file, to enable type checking for applications that are
  embedding ptpython.


3.0.5: 2020-08-10
-----------------

Fixes:
- Handle bug in dictionary completion when numeric keys are used.

3.0.3: 2020-07-10
-----------------

Fixes:
- Sort attribute names for `DictionaryCompleter` and move underscored
  attributes to the end.
- Handle unhandled exceptions in `get_compiler_flags`.
- Improved `run_async` code.
- Fix --version parameter.


3.0.2: 2020-04-14
-----------------

New features:
- Improved custom dictionary completion:
    * Also complete list indexes.
    * Also complete attributes after doing a dictionary lookup.
    * Also complete iterators in a for-loop.
- Added a 'title' option, so that applications embedding ptpython can set a
  title in the status bar.

  django-extensions).
